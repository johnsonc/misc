A tiny repository containing a bunch of scripts, configuration files and programs maybe.

This is a custom gedit colorscheme file. Mainly because I don't like any of the default dark themes and because I find that dark themes hurt my eyes much less than light themes.

Language-specific classes for the different color sets available can be found somewhere along your gtksourceview search path. As documented [here] [1], this path is typically something like:

1. ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/
2. /usr/share/gnome/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/
3. /usr/local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/
4. /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles/

(Replace 3.0 with 2.0 if you're still using gtksourceview-2.0)

There used to be a nice program that allowed you to create custom colorschemes (called 'badschemer' if I remember right). Alas it no longer seems to work with gtksourceview-3.0.
